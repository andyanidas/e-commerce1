        Grass, any of many low, green, nonwoody plants belonging to the grass family (Poaceae), the sedge family
        (Cyperaceae), and the rush family (Juncaceae). There are many grasslike members of other flowering plant
        families, but only the approximately 10,000 species in the family Poaceae are true grasses.

        They are economically the most important of all flowering plants because of their nutritious grains and
        soil-forming function, and they have the most-widespread distribution and the largest number of individuals.
        Grasses provide forage for grazing animals, shelter for wildlife, construction materials, furniture, utensils,
        and food for humans.
